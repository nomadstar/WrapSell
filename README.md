# WrapSell

A decentralized banking system that uses Pokémon TCG cards as collateral to mint stablecoins, creating a fiat-free currency backed by trading card value.

## Overview

WrapSell transforms your Pokémon TCG card collection into a digital asset that can be used as collateral for minting stablecoins. The system ensures that each token is backed by real card value.

## System Architecture

The project is divided into three main components:

### 1. Frontend
- User interface for managing card collections
- Real-time card value tracking
- Token minting and burning interface
- Collection management dashboard

### 2. Backend
- Centralized card database
- Market value tracking system
- Price data aggregation

### 3. Smart Contracts
- Chainlink integration for price feeds
- Collateral validation system

## How It Works

1. **Collection Management**
   - Users register their Pokémon TCG cards
   - System tracks current market values
   - Collection value is calculated in real-time

2. **Token Minting Process**
   - Smart contract checks collection value via Chainlink
   - System validates collateral sufficiency
   - New tokens are minted based on available collateral
   - Only authorized addresses can execute minting

3. **Value Tracking**
   - Real-time price updates
   - Automated collateral verification

## User Flow Example

1. **Initial Setup**
   - User connects his wallet to WrapSell
   - He creates an account and verifies his identity

2. **Card Registration**
   - User submits their physical card to WrapSell's secure facility
   - Card is stored in our secure vault
   - Digital representation is created in our system
   - User receives a digital certificate of ownership

3. **Collateralization Process**
   - Smart contract receives card value from Chainlink
   - System calculates available collateral (e.g., 80% of card value = $400)
   - User can now mint up to $400 worth of WrapSell tokens

4. **Token Minting**
   - User requests to mint 200 WrapSell tokens
   - Smart contract verifies:
     - Card value is sufficient
     - User's wallet is authorized
     - Collateral ratio is maintained
   - Tokens are minted and sent to User wallet

5. **Using WrapSell Tokens**
   - User can now use his tokens like any other stablecoin
   - He can transfer them to other users
   - Use them for purchases
   - Trade them on DEXs

6. **Token Burning**
   - When User wants to retrieve his card
   - He burns his WrapSell tokens
   - Smart contract verifies the burn
   - Card ownership is transferred back to User
   - Physical card is returned to User

7. **Value Updates**
   - System continuously monitors card market values
   - If card value increases, User can mint more tokens
   - If value decreases, system may require additional collateral

This process creates a secure, transparent system where physical card value is transformed into digital assets while maintaining the security of the original collateral.
